# candour-cockatrice-import
An import for the custom card Candour format into the game platform Cockatrice.

# TO IMPORT
1. Download Cockatrice if you haven't already ([Download it ONLY from their website](https://cockatrice.github.io/))
2. Download the 0X.Candour.xml files found in this repository
3. Open Cockatrice
4. Under the "Card Database" tab click "Open Custom Sets Folder"
5. Move the 0X.Candour.xml files into this folder. If you already have custom sets, either change the numbers on your files, or change the numbers in the Candour files so they do not overlap. (i.e. only have one file named 01.[NAME].xml)
6. Restart Cockatrice, and click yes to enable the new set(s) that have been found.
